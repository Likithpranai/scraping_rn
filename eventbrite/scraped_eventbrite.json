    "description": "Hey, Hong Kong! When was the last time you did something completely spontaneous? Our series groups together complete strangers for a fun day out. That's right, you sign up, and we book the restaurant. We know life can get busy. Don't forget to spend time making new friends! Don't do city life alone and build your community with us. This project is to host dinners in 100 major cities to combat loneliness while supporting locally owned businesses. We are dedicating 25% of sales towards charity or GoFundMe pages at the end of each month. How does it work? -After you register, you'll be emailed an introduction message including a quick questionnaire regarding age, dietary restrictions, hobbies, and interests that we use to select restaurants for the night's group. -At the end of the month, we'll share sales reports with attendees and detail how we are utilizing 25% of sales towards social good. *Your registration does not include your individual food and drink purchases. *These outings are intended to help people make friends. These are not singles gatherings. Our vision is simple: we take the no gimmicks approach to networking. No need for yet another app to take up space on your phone - just four walls and a roof and good food for people to connect :) We coordinate with you directly, human-to-human. If you have any more questions, please contact ermantourageimpact@gmail.com! Brought to you by event series Ermantourage. You can also take a look at our main event calendar via Posh for coffee meets, evening hangouts, and more!",

That's right, you sign up, and we book the restaurant. We know life can get busy. Don't forget to spend time making new friends! Why do city life alone when you can build your community with us. Embrace the awkwardness of meeting new people for the first time blindly: all ages, interests, hobbies, and backgrounds. This project is to host dinners in 100 cities to combat loneliness in the modern world while supporting locally owned businesses. Each month, dinner is held at a different restaurant. These dinners are not directly associated with the restaurants, but are simply based on a table reservation. This micro-event is intended to be for 4-6 people maximum. If the evening you signed up for does not hit the minimum number of signups, please be open to joining us on another night with a fuller group. Check out our feature in Eventbrite's 2025 TRNDS report about embracing the micro-event trend. How does it work? After you register, you'll be emailed an introduction message. We'll stay in touch with you leading up to the night of the dinner. Expect a Final Details email the day of. *Your registration does not include your individual food and drink purchases. A paid ticket simply makes you more committed to actually showing up. *Sign up one time, and you'll join our database to be invited to all dinners. *These outings are intended to help people make friends. These are not singles gatherings. *If you sign up the day of the gathering and do not get a welcoming message from us in time, simply email ermantourageimpact@gmail.com, request a refund, or please be open to joining us on another evening. Our vision is simple: we take the no gimmicks approach to networking. No need for yet another app to take up space on your phone - just four walls and a roof and good food for people to connect :) We coordinate with you directly, human-to-human.

This isn't about quitting your job tomorrow. It's about building options so you can actually live life on your own terms. What we'll cover depends on what you ask, but might include: You're doing well on paper but something's off. Maybe you're missing family stuff because of work, or you want flexibility but can't afford the pay cut, or you just know there's got to be a better way than grinding until retirement. Come with your questions. Whether it's about starting a side business, transitioning careers, or just figuring out what you actually want - we'll work through it together. Ready to build some options? Bring your questions about time freedom, financial freedom, and living life on your own terms. Let's figure this out. \"Half the doctors I asked said they'd quit tomorrow if they won the lottery. The other half said they'd work part-time. That's when I realized I was heading toward the same trap - and decided to build my way out.\" Space is limited to ensure an intimate, high-value experience.",

The creation of Organic Hill was personal, it was health conscious, it was me. Leon's Organic wine journey began personally back in 2009 when he realised that he was Gluten intolerant (not Coeliac) and needed to find Gluten free products. This led him to discover the myriad of Organic shops located in and around Melbourne, many of which also sold Organic wine. After lots of trial and error searching for a solution to my intolerances, it became obvious that it was also Preservatives that I was allergic to, therefore Organic simply made sense. ===== 📅 31/07/2025 (Thursday) 🕗 19:30 🏠 The Victuals 3/F, Bayfield Building, 99 Hennessy Road, Wan Chai 💰 $980 (4 Courses Menu) 🍽️Sous Vide Watermelon with Tiger Prawns 🍽️Pan Seared Matsusaka Pork Toro 🍽️Dry Aged Beef Cannelloni 🍽️Grilled Greekstone Prime Ribeye 🍷Paired with 6 glasses of Australian Organic Wine and a cult red wine worth $1380 per bottle ===== Little Bit More About Organic Hill Wines~ Organic Hill Winemaker - Matt Wenk ⭐Former chief winemaker for Two Hands Wines (2002 - 2013) ⭐A fact that is largely unknown Matt remains the only winemaker in the world to have wines of his making in internationally acclaimed Wine Spectator top 100 for 10 consecutive years.",

    "description": "Most of the tourists visit Hong Kong Island and Kowloon but rarely visit New Territories. People asked me where are the buildings over 300 years old. The British colonial period started in 1841 (only 182 years ago). What did Hong Kong look like in the pre-colonial period? In this tour, I will take you to the ancestral hall of the traditional Chinese House. I will also show you the tradition of worshipping god in a temple. 1. Traditional Walled Village - Tsang Tai UkOne of Hong Kong’s best-preserved walled villages. You can still see the original granite, bricks and timber used to build the village. Guard towers were built on each of the four corners to protect against pirates, who ran rampant in Hong Kong until the early 20th century. This is still a living village. 2. Sha Tin Che Kung TempleThis is a temple of 300 years old. Was built before the colonial period. You will learn about the traditional culture 3. The Old House at Wong Uk Village Wong Uk Village was founded during the reign of Qianlong (1736-1795) in the Qing dynasty by the Wong clan from Xingning county in Guangdong. In the 19th century, the village became a major trading station for travellers and traders plying the route between Guangdong and Kowloon and prospered until the late 19th century. I will show you how to appreciate the fine mural paintings and traditional decorations on the traditional house. 4.High Rock Centre It was old police barracks of Shatin and also the place for orphans. The main building was a large, two-storey brick and wood building. 5 ,6,7..... and more places in the tours. By the end of the tour, you will have more understanding of the traditional side of Hong Kong Meeting Point: We will meet at Tai Wai Station Exit B. In front of DHL express.Tai Wai Station is on East Rail Line of the MTR. The tips for the tour will be collected at the beginning of the tour, HK$300 per person. More than 3 people will be offered a discount. If you want to have a one-person tour, HK$500. I guarantee it is worth the cost.",

It is best known for offering the most authentic yoga experience available in Hong Kong, with classes led by Indian instructors hailing from different lineages devoted to the practice and study of yoga. As a centre, Anahata Yoga is fully committed to fostering a community of yoga practitioners who are not only equipped with the skills to perform yoga as a daily activity, but as well as the knowledge to live out yoga as a lifestyle. Starting a yoga practice at a young age creates a healthy life for youngsters. By nature, children’s minds and bodies are flexible, adaptable and easily teachable. So long as yoga is fun, creative and interactive, it’s an activity they’re sure to like. In addition to being a great physical activity, yoga offers an entertaining way for children to learn about the mind and body, and their functions and abilities. Children also learn to balance their emotions and improve their focus and concentration through yoga. Various studies have shown that children who regularly practice yoga have better health and emotional balance, and are less likely to be afflicted with common health issues such as allergies, asthma, digestive disorders, obesity, ADD and ADHD. At Anahata Yoga, parents who enjoy yoga also pave the way for their children to enjoy the activity, making yoga a regular family activity and cultivating a healthy lifestyle. And just as yoga can be tailored according to the needs and capacities of every individual, so can kids’ yoga be designed to match the interests of every individual child – not only ensuring a healthy body and mind, but also some fun and laughter along the way. Anahata Yoga’s Kids’ Yoga Teacher Training Course (100 hours) is one of the first accredited Certification Programme for Kid’s yoga in Hong Kong. Anahata Yoga offers a solid foundational grounding of yoga instruction and mindful yoga practices for children. Students learn the physiology and psychology of children of various age groups, and how to incorporate yoga to their leisure time as a hobby, a sport, and a discipline in a fun and creative way. “It takes a big heart to shape little minds,” it is said. At Anahata Yoga, students learn to teach kids’ yoga from the heart. At the end of our programme, students will be able to confidently teach yoga to children and design creative yoga classes for children of various age groups.

    "description": "Anahata Yoga is a premiere yoga centre based in the heart of the Central district. It is best known for offering the most authentic yoga experience available in Hong Kong, with classes led by Indian instructors hailing from different lineages devoted to the practice and study of yoga. As a centre, Anahata Yoga is fully committed to fostering a community of yoga practitioners who are not only equipped with the skills to perform yoga as a daily activity, but as well as the knowledge to live out yoga as a lifestyle. Anahata Yoga’s 200 Hours Teacher Training Certificate course gives yoga practitioners, enthusiasts, and aspiring instructors the chance to deepen their self-knowledge of yoga philosophy and improve on various aspects of their practice. It is an open-level training programme, suitable for those who have never done yoga before as well as those who have put in years of practice. Through the course, students gain a better understanding of yoga’s origins, history, as well as its philosophy. Students also learn how they may improve on their postures, that they may execute them with accuracy and, later, be able to demonstrate it to others. We recognize that yoga is a popular pursuit in Hong Kong. People seek it out for its health benefits and often incorporate it into their active lifestyles. However, yoga instruction is not equal among the various yoga centres in Hong Kong. This is where our accredited Teacher Training Courses make all the difference. Our courses are accredited by and offered in conjunction with, Asana Andiappan College of Yoga and Research Centre in India. This is the first time outside of India that such a programme is being offered. Our classes are designed and taught in the same way as our instructors are taught. Predominantly from India, our instructors are fully learned not only in the practice of their discipline but also in the history and philosophy behind the practice. The resulting combination of grassroots knowledge both practical and theoretical in our programmes give students more in-depth learning that they may able to find elsewhere in Hong Kong.",

    "description": "Le spectacle Amandine s'est beaucoup cherchée. Beaucoup, beaucoup. Elle a tellement cherché qu'à un moment elle a même envisagé une formation de chien truffier. Ce spectacle c'est comme un petit personnage de bd qui passerait de bulle en bulle sans jamais trouver de siège libre pour son fessier, sans trouver sa place. À force de rester debout elle a fait du stand up. Et vous a trouvés, vous.Un moment de scène où elle se livre, à fleur de pot de départ. Spectacle pour trentenaires déglinguées. «Elle allie érudition et vente à la criée.» Un mec une fois. La presse en parle “Sa voix rocailleuse, son regard, sa force d’écriture : absolument tout impressionne.” — Nouvel Obs “Avec sa gouaille impayable, cette nouvelle venue prometteuse narre sa condition de femme célibataire malgré elle avec une verve qui fait mouche.” — Le Monde “Sa verve de prolo, son observation du quotidien et sa plume cynique font mouche.” — Télérama L'humoriste Née le 27 mars 1988 à Troyes, Amandine Lourdel est une humoriste française dont le parcours atypique mêle théâtre, cinéma et stand-up.Issue d’une formation théâtrale solide, elle obtient en 2006 une mention très bien au Conservatoire de théâtre de Troyes, suivie d’un diplôme de l’ESRA en 2010. Elle poursuit sa formation au Cours Simon en 2011, puis au Conservatoire du 20ᵉ arrondissement de Paris, dont elle sort diplômée en 2015. En 2019, Amandine crée sa propre compagnie et lance les soirées “Cabaret”. C’est en 2021, après la pandémie, qu’elle se lance pleinement dans le stand-up. En deux saisons, elle se fait remarquer sur de nombreux plateaux et festivals d’humour, remportant plusieurs prix. En 2024, elle est programmée au BO Saint Martin, participe au festival d’Avignon et rejoint la Bande Originale sur France Inter. Elle intègre également la liste des artistes produits par TS3 Prod, un gage de la qualité et de l'originalité de ses performances. Son spectacle “Renversée” est salué pour son humour frontal, oscillant entre sarcasme, ironie et satire sociale. Elle y dissèque mœurs et appartenances avec une gouaille sans pareil. Sa plume acérée et sa présence scénique magnétique font d’elle une voix incontournable du stand-up français Info billetterie Date : mercredi 17 septembre 2025 à 20h Tarifs : • 290 HKD en prévente jusqu’au 30 juin 2025 à 23h45, ou dans la limite des places disponibles • 340 HKD en billet standard Adresse : Basehall 02, 1 Connaught Place, #LG/F, Central, Hong Kong Island Spectacle en placement libre.

Guided by experts, you’ll have the unique opportunity to create your very own herbarium specimen—perfect to display at home or gift to loved ones—while discovering how science and artistry come together in this timeless practice.

Our peer-led groups provide a supportive and understanding environment for anyone navigating grief influenced by factors such as, but not limited to, suicide loss, estrangement, being cut off or distant from the person who died, traumatic loss, multiple losses, relationship breakdown or stigma. What happens:A peer support group is where people come together to share personal stories, listen and support one another with kindness. You will be welcomed by two hosts who are trained TNN volunteers with lived experience on the topic of the group. It is normal to feel nervous, and sharing can be a big decision. Remember you are deserving of care and support. You are welcome to join us and just listen. Our hosts will welcome you and provide an introduction, then we will ask you to introduce yourself and your reason for joining us. From then on there is no pressure to speak. Our hosts will facilitate the conversation. A peer support group is a supportive space where people can: Share stories and how our experiences are currently impacting our lives Talk about our feelings and emotions Share and discuss coping strategies Group guidelines: We have some basic guidelines that we ask everyone to adhere to, to ensure this remains an inclusive space for everyone: Please note: As a peer support group, this group is for peers to share their personal struggles and support one another.

Whether painting, running, or quietly thinking, a well-cared-for body is always your strongest partner. Psychologist Snyder's \"Hope Theory\" suggests a healthy body is not only the result of hope but also a source of hope. When we nourish our bodies through food, we build motivation to chase goals and strengthen problem-solving ability. When it comes to health, something as intuitive as eating has become unnecessarily complicated; what nourishes us has now caused problems. How might we eat properly without compromising gastronomical pursuits? Here’s a good news from the leading artist Tung: there’s a way out! In this workshop on food and body awareness, fitness coach/writer Yat will lead us through muscle training. Subsequently, chef/editor Alan will prepare a healthy, light meal. Explore how food helps your body reach its ideal state and responds to creativity and exercise rhythms. Starting with \"eat well,” we'll make food an integral part of our cultural practice as a way to “live well” with hope. _______________________ 費用全免(參加者須預繳港幣100元可退還按金) Free (participants are required to settle a refundable deposit at HKD100 to secure their registration) _______________________ 導師 Instructors 羅維日（阿日）Law Wai Yat (Yat) 健齡13年，由35吋肚腩到24/7腹肌，期望諸君食得開心操得順心，不再把白烚無鹽誤會成健康的不二法門。 With 13 years of fitness experience, gone from a 35-inch waist to having abs all day. Hope everyone enjoy eating and exercising without thinking plain boiled food is the only healthy option. 虞興華 Alan Yu 《Sample樣本》雜誌編輯，因貪食而轉行，現職廚師。相信透過理解食物與技術的本質，可以讓簡單的食物也變得美味。最愛的食物是漢堡和牛扒。 Editor of Sample magazine turned chef.

Since then, the show has gone places, in person or offline, before and during COVID-19: New York, Singapore, Vancouver, and Hong Kong. Nominated for IATCHK Performer of the Year and HK Theatre Libre Outstanding Lead Actress, Annie masterfully blends tragedy and comedy in DOTS, a critically acclaimed solo performance that lays bare the struggles of a high-achieving, yet insecure mind.

This campaign encourages the public to look beyond the typical, stigmatising, labels associated with mental health diagnoses. Through personal stories of mental health journeys, we want to showcase realistic portrayals of people who have faced mental health problems and recovered and depict their holistic identity. With this campaign, we hope to raise awareness of the stigma towards persons with mental health conditions, celebrate the resilience and strength of people in recovery, and educate and equip the public with mental health knowledge. We believe this will facilitate more conversation in mental health, which will in turn help destigmatise mental health in Hong Kong. 「我就是我More Than a Label」是由香港心聆策劃的計劃，並得到思健作爲夥伴與贊助商，以及宏利的贊助。計劃源於我們希望改變大眾對精神疾病患者的觀感。此計劃透過邀請復元人士分享他們的精神健康復元故事，來展示他們最真實的一面、描繪最真實的自己，藉此鼓勵大眾擺脫對精神疾病的固有觀念、污名及標籤。 我們希望透過這個計劃來提升大眾對精神疾病及其污名的認知，並為復元人士充權。我們深信這次計劃能鼓勵社會大眾展開更多有關精神健康的對話，協助消除有關精神健康的污名。",

After 6 years of balancing his passion with a corporate career, he made a bold move in 2018 to pursue comedy full-time. His dedication paid off when, last year, his comedy special, Professional Mixed Breed, premiered globally on Netflix, marking a major milestone as the first Penang-born comedian to achieve this. With over a decade of experience and over 1,000 events under his belt, he is known for his corporate-friendly and intelligent comedy suited for everyone! Here's what Gajen has to say about this show: \"Listen, I mean read, here is my brand new 1-hour comedy special, Global Malaysian Chindian.\" This is a sequel to my previous special, Professional Mixed Breed, in 2022 (it's on Netflix!). In this show, I go deep into my roots and beginnings. From my Chindian childhood in the 90s, strict Indian family career expectations, engineering life, my Germany adventures, and...my niche toilet preferences. As always, the jokes are clean, culturally relatable, and perfect for locals and international friends alike! Bring your friends, dates, parents...even your ex. I promise it won’t be weird. See you soon!\" This show is in English",

Hot Club de Hong Kong可能是香港唯一活躍的法式吉卜賽爵士(Gypsy Jazz/Jazz Manouche)樂隊，為你呈獻上世紀三四十年代嘅巴黎韻味。 Hot Club de Hong Kong由本地樂隊Cowhead與Blaster兩位結他手Simon Choi與Neil Lau，兩個畢業於香港教育大學音樂系嘅小提琴手Bob Pang 、結他手Sing Pun和低音大提琴手Vera組成。成員們彈奏各音樂類型多年，機緣巧合下認識到嚟自法國嘅吉卜賽爵士樂，被深深吸引，於是組成Hot Club de Hong Kong。 樂隊演奏風格啟發自吉卜賽爵士奠基者Django Reinhardt及Stéphane Grappelli，以三十年代巴黎風格為基調，糅合美式爵士、拉丁節奏，以原聲結他同小提琴演奏一系列吉卜賽爵士及爵士標準曲。 現時世界各地皆有Hot Club，向Hot Club de France的Django Reinhardt致敬。Hot Club de Hong Kong致力在香港普及吉卜賽爵士樂、建立爵士樂社群、為本土音樂注入新元素。 Allure Music Salon: Evenings of Music and Mastery Allure Music Salon, nestled in Tai Hang's historic Century Stone House, Hong Kong, hosts enthralling musical evenings and workshops.

    "description": "Overview Ever since the explosion of TV show \"Who's Line is it Anyway?\", the short-form style of improv (consisting of short scenes combining audience suggestions, improviser talents and pre-selected rules) has become synonymous with improv comedy. Though by no means the only style of improv, it is one that TBC Improv specialises in and this course will teach you the techniques behind it. Each class in the 8-week course will explore a particular genre of game: what games fall into the category, what skills they use and techniques for performing scenes within them. Become familiar with new games and reacquainted with old favourites! This course is ideally aimed at: those with some basic improv training and wishing to expand further; those who wish to specialise in short-form improv; performers with long-form background/experience wishing to become more relaxed and familiar with short-form improv.

    "description": "What happens when technical conversations go over your head? When decisions are made based on jargon you don’t fully understand? Or when you want to uncover what’s slowing down delivery without always needing a developer to translate? The age-old debate: should a Scrum Master be technical? It’s a hot topic, one that sparks discussions, debates, confusion, curiosity, and even controversy. But the answer is actually quite simple: it doesn’t really matter. There are highly successful technical Scrum Masters, and there are non-technical ones who fail miserably, and vice versa. It depends on many factors. But one thing is certain: having technical knowledge in your Scrum backpack is never a bad thing. This one-day workshop won’t turn you into a full-fledged Developer, that would be absurd to promise. What it will do is give you a solid foundation in IT and software engineering without writing a single line of code. Facilitated by seasoned technical trainers who’ve worked in the trenches, supported by the collective knowledge of the group, and yes, let’s be real, some help from AI, we’ll explore key technical concepts and dive into modern development workflows. Whether you’re dealing with legacy systems, cloud-native platforms, or anything in between, this day will equip you to ask better questions, spot risks earlier, engage more confidently in technical discussions, and foster stronger collaboration with your Developers, technical stakeholders, and teams while staying true to the Scrum Master accountabilities.",

    "description": "Join us for a transformative experience this fall at the Natural Building Workshops, a unique collaboration between Alex from Bisque-kit, Ania from Ania Natural Materials, and Jenny from Ark Eden. This hands-on series is designed to introduce participants to sustainable building techniques, reconnect them with nature, and nurture creativity in the process. Our expert instructors bring a wealth of knowledge and diverse experience from around the globe: Together, these three professionals bring expertise in architectural design, hands-on natural building, and environmental sustainability to create an unforgettable learning experience. Discover the fascinating world of sgraffito, an ancient decorative technique used in clay plastering to create intricate, textured designs by scratching through a layer of material to reveal contrasting colors beneath. This method, originating from Italy, has been used for centuries in architecture and art, offering a unique way to add depth and detail to surfaces. In this 2-day workshop, you'll learn both the history and the hands-on practice of sgraffito. Day 1: We begin with an introduction to the history and theory behind sgraffito, exploring its cultural significance and uses throughout time. Then, you'll dive into the practice by collaborating on a large wall design, learning the technique together as you scratch through layers of clay and pigment. Day 2: On the second day, you'll have the opportunity to design and execute your own personalized sgraffito artwork. We will guide you through the process of creating custom colors from mineral pigments and clay, as well as incorporating natural elements like crushed shells and glass for added texture and vibrancy. By the end of the workshop, you’ll leave with your own unique sgraffito piece, a deeper understanding of this ancient technique, and the skills to incorporate it into future creative projects. In between your morning and afternoon workshops, participants will enjoy a freshly made vegetarian buffet lunch and light refreshments are available through out the day. Participants will receive a comprehensive information package upon ticket purchase, which will include details on how to get to the site, what to wear, and other essential information. Special Discounts:We offer discounted prices for students with a valid student ID. Whether you're passionate about sustainable living, keen to try new creative skills, or simply curious about building with natural materials, this series of workshops will empower you to make a meaningful connection to the earth and learn new skills that can last a lifetime. NOTE: A one day ticket is available for students. This is only available for saturday's session. For any questions please email: hibisquekit@gmail.com or visit our instagram page @bisque.kit Terms and Conditions: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ We’re kicking off the series with a family-friendly day on 29th October that’s all about play, creativity, and getting in touch with nature. This relaxed and interactive workshop is ideal for children and families to explore natural building materials, create art, and try out basic building techniques in a fun, creative environment. Following the family day, our specialized workshops dive deeper into natural building methods and are perfect for adults and older children. These workshops combine learning with hands-on experience as participants work on a live project and see their efforts come to life!Workshops include: Discounted Workshop Packages:Participants can choose to attend one individual workshop or purchase a discounted package for 4 workshops.

You might be in this position involuntarily, experiencing financial pressures, loss of identity, routine, or purpose, facing rejection in your job search, feeling lonely, or uncertain about the future. This is a forum for people to share the difficult emotions around not being in full-time employment, which provides not only income but also an identity, structure to your day, social contact, and often a purpose. What this is not - A forum to discuss the practicalities of job searches - A networking opportunity What happens A peer support group is where people come together to share personal stories, listen and support one another with kindness. You will be welcomed by two hosts who are trained TNN volunteers with lived experience in the topic of the group. It is normal to feel nervous, and sharing can be a big decision. Remember you are deserving of care and support. You are welcome to join us and just listen. Our hosts will welcome you and provide an introduction, then we will ask you to introduce yourself and your reason for joining us. From then on there is no pressure to speak. Our hosts will facilitate conversation. A peer support group is a supportive space where people can: Share stories and how our experiences are currently impacting our lives Talk about our feelings and emotions Share and discuss coping strategies Group guidelines We have some basic guidance that we ask everyone to adhere to, to ensure this remains an inclusive space for everyone: Please note As a peer support group, this group is for peers to share their personal struggles and support one another. Attendees are welcome to come and listen but it is not a space to observe. You should attend to engage in peer support. It is not a space for students to contribute to their studies, for clinicians to observe, or for the press unless written agreement from the charity has been obtained. Who are The New Normal Charity? We are a Hong Kong S88 registered charity. The New Normal Hong Kong has been hosting our free peer support groups in Hong Kong since 2022. Our groups are facilitated by volunteers. While our hosts are trained to facilitate, we are not mental health professionals in this space. We do not give advice, we provide space for all of you to share, connect and support. Nobody should ever feel alone, and there is always somebody who can relate to your story. www.thenewnormalcharityhk.org If you are in crisis and don’t feel like you can keep yourself safe there are immediate services available. 危機求助熱線如果你覺得你不能保證自己的安全 Samaritans 2341 7227 (until 10pm) 2389 2222 (24/7) Caritas 18288 SPS Hotline 23820000 Address WYNG 16/F, Chun Wo Commercial Centre 23-27 Wing Wo Street, Sheung Wan, Hong Kong Island How to get there 2 minute walk from Sheung Wan Station:From Exit E1, turn right and walk along Des Voeux Rd Central.

This time, renowned Erhu virtuoso Chan Pik-Sum returns with an exciting new ensemble to captivate audiences once again. With the hauntingly beautiful sounds of the Erhu, Yangqin, and Sanxian, prepare for a sensory journey that seamlessly blends tradition with timeless artistry. This is more than music—it’s an experience steeped in elegance, emotion, and undeniable charm. 走進Allure的百年石屋，享受一場令人著迷的古代中國旋律之夜。著名二胡演奏家陳璧沁此次帶著全新組合回歸，再次為觀眾帶來扣人心弦的音樂體驗。伴隨著二胡、揚琴與三弦那動人心魄的悅耳聲音，準備好展開一場融合傳統與永恆藝術的感官旅程。這不僅僅是音樂，而是一場充滿優雅、情感與無法抗拒魅力的非凡體驗。 Explore the Artistry of Musicians The Sirens emerged out of informal acoustic jams and late-night harmonising in the street after closing time to create a unique alternative folk sound. Made up of four Lamma women: Aleks (fiddle), Erin (guitar), Jeni (cello) and Lebo (cajon) re-interpret everything from traditional Irish to The Eurythmics, by way of Neil Young, Eva Cassidy, and Amy Winehouse. The Sirens’ harmonies lean towards a mysterious, moody sound evocative of their mythological namesakes luring sailors lost at sea.

    "description": "Established in 1977, Tai Po Kau Nature Reserve is a land of 460 hectares, containing some of Hong Kong’s most mature secondary forests along with many of Hong Kong’s fauna. Nowadays, it has easily become one of the most popular and well-known wildlife spots, providing a safe haven for a plethora of wildlife species, such as migratory birds and Hong Kong warty newts during the winter months, as well as frogs and many different types of arthropods in the summer months. Regular sightings include Red Muntjac, a small and only member of the deer family in Hong Kong, along with East Asian Porcupines and Wild Boars, while certain amount of luck is required to encounter the elusive Leopard Cat. On this night tour, we will explore the lowest levels of this huge nature reserve, where we may see frogs near the ponds and rivers, moths fluttering about, insects resting on the plantation, and maybe even bats flying through the night sky. Tai Po Kau is also a well known location to see Fireflies, which breed from March to November, with breeding peaking between May to August. Dwarf Wood Scorpians are also common at Tai Po Kau, with the aid of UV lights we will be able to see these shy nocturnal creatures at their best, as their exoskeleten glows a bright cyan-green under UV lights. Join us as we explore the nocturnal fauna of Hong Kong Tour Fee: $330 for adults, $250 for children under 8 (minimum age is 3 years old) Meeting location: Tai Po Kau Nature reserve entrance (To get there by public transport, go to Tai Po Market MTR Exit A, take mini-bus 28k and ask to be dropped off at the \"Tsung Tsai Yuen\" bus station) Walking Distance: 5km Walk grade: Easy to moderate Terrain: Paved and nature paths, some steps Facilities: Toilets along route What to bring: Night torch or headlamps, bottle with drinking water, mosquito repellent Refund Policy • For a full refund, cancel at least 24 hours in advance of the start date of the experience. • The event will be fully refunded if tour is canceled due to yellow/red/black rain or thunderstorm warning .",

He has also performed in Mainland China, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Singapore. Tim is not only active in Hong Kong, he also performed in Mainland, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore & Australia. In 2017, Tim was invited by TEDxYOUTH to be a TEDx speaker. “Tim's jokes sound like someone recalling a night out whilst it's still happening and somehow funnier” - Ashley James Tim To is a Chinese Canadian comedian, he grew up in Toronto and has spent about a decade living in Hong Kong. His comedic style explores his unhinged interpretation of his experiences and defines his own brand of logic. In 2020, he was the winner of BushiRoast 4 and continues to explore his comedic style in shows throughout Hong Kong. Tim Lam is American Chinese and grew up in Singapore. Having originally worked in finance, he ended up in culinary school for a year, thus becoming the most disappointing Chinese first born son ever. He also showers regularly and lives with a cat. Caro Chan is a dynamic half-Chinese, half-African comedian based in Hong Kong, known for her unique perspective and vibrant stage presence. With a playful charm and a smile that lights up the room, Caro brings a wealth of storytelling and performance skills to her comedy. She made her stand-up debut in September 2023, quickly captivating audiences with her sharp wit and relatable humor. Caro's performances often explore themes of cultural identity and the nuances of life in a diverse city, making her a fresh voice in the Hong Kong comedy scene. Ha Chu is a stand up comedian from Hong Kong. His unique comedy style has brought him to stages across Asia, Australia and Europe. He is the first comedian from Asia to perform at the Christiania Comedy Club (Denmark). He was chosen by Melbourne International Comedy Festival to perform at the MICF- “Comedy Zone Asia”. He is a regular at the Hong Kong International Comedy Festival as well as the past winner of the Hong Kong International Comedy Competition. “One of the most original comedians I have worked with. In my opinion, he’s a must see comedian.” - Tom Cotter (USA) Chris Musni is a San Francisco native who moved to Hong Kong to achieve his lifelong dream of fame and fortune. Failing that, he took the stage and developed a witty comedic style that forces the audience to ask themselves questions such as “Why are things the way they are?” or “When is this show going to end?” When not onstage you can find Chris’s big nose in a nonfiction book while thinking he’s better than you or he might be shooting hoops with basketballs in Tseung Kwan O. \"Very good.\" - Tom Arnold",

    "description": "BODY COUNT is a visceral and provocative exploration of the human form as both a site of trauma and resilience. Through a fusion of performance and mixed-media installation the piece interrogates the ways bodies are quantified, commodified, and politicized—whether in war, healthcare, or systemic violence. Drawing from inspiration: forensic anthropology, memorial archives and personal narratives, the work distorts and reconstructs the body, challenging viewers to confront the tension between individual identity and statistical anonymity. Fragmented, multiplied, or erased, the forms question: When does a body become a number? Who gets counted, and who remains invisible? With specific elements like repetitive silhouettes, raw data sonified and visualized, _Body Count_ oscillates between the intimate and the impersonal, urging a reckoning with the weight of collective loss and the fragility of corporeal existence. ________ Philipp Henkel is a German composer, curator, and multimedia artist based in Hannover. In his music, gestural instability and extended expressionism transform the subjective listening experience. His compositions and multimedia works explore the implications of technology and societal failure(s) through a research-led approach. In 2018 Henkel founded neuMERZ an interdisciplinary studio for research led art projects and curation in which he remains the artistic lead. Recent concerts and exhibitions of his work have taken place at GAIDA Festival in Lithuania, 21st Century Art Museum Kanazawa, Ryoguku Monten Hall Tokyo, Monopol Berlin, ZKM Karlsruhe.",

    "description": "“Channelling” is a kinetic audiovisual project, in which a collection of motor devices salvaged from obsolete and discarded consumer technology is reanimated by environmental sound recordings. In turn, this produces new sounds from the devices, which are amplifed using various microphones and techniques. The recordings feature seemingly mundane sound phenomena that occur unpredictably and irregularly in everyday life – passing traffic, wind, doors closing – and also sounds of other machines malfunctioning. Because of this, the movement of the devices is random, variable, and autonomous. This means the relationship between performer and devices is a collaboration rather than a master and servant type situation. “Channelling Reduction” follows the trend of technology to miniaturise as it evolves, becoming smaller and lighter, but more powerful. Simon Whetham: Since 2005 Simon Whetham has worked with sonic activity as a material. He often uses environmental sound, employing a variety of methods and techniques in order to obtain often unnoticed and obscured sonic phenomena. He also explores ways of creating physical traces of sound and transforming energy forms. Whetham performs and exhibits internationally, has received a large number of commissions and awards, has many published composed works and regularly collaborates with other artists. His practice also covers giving active listening, field recording and technology repurposing workshops.",

It explores the emotional landscape of relationships that faded without closure—those moments suspended in silence and unresolved endings. Through four original compositions, the work navigates cycles of memory, doubt, and longing, while ultimately offering a fragile sense of hope. Premiered in Zürich in 2025, the piece is an attempt to sonify the unsaid and give voice to what was left behind.",

    "description": "This presentation will introduce Edward Sanderson's research into the spaces for sound art and experimental music as they have developed in the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong, and describe some of my recent activities based on this research. For the last 15 years or so he has focused on spaces for sound art and experimental music and spatially-related practices that find their homes in these spaces. Geographically, he restricts himself to the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong (already a huge area), and the period is from the late 1990s to the present day, although he also deals with some earlier material for context. This research has led him to build up a physical archive of material, currently based in Hong Kong, and from this I have produced various texts, events, and curated exhibitions. This talk will be structured around four important stages in the development of this research: His PhD at HK Baptist University's Academy of Visual Art; the 2023 “Sounds Like Print” display at Tai Kwun Contemporary; the recently concluded exhibition “It Always Sounds Somewhere” at the Inside-Out Art Museum in Beijing; and the performance series “Exit-Entry” which invites Mainland artists to perform alongside local artists, and which serves as a further means to promote connections and knowledge sharing between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong. _______________ Bio: Dr. Edward Sanderson is a researcher and curator focusing on contemporary non-mainstream sonic practices from the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong. In 2025 Edward curated the exhibition \"It Always Sounds Somewhere\" at Inside-Out Art Museum in Beijing, presenting an extensive set of installations of the multiple forms of space used for sound art and experimental music, supplemented by a series of related performances and talks. Edward is currently developing a physical and online archive of sound-related material, and co-curating the Exit-Entry performance series bringing together Chinese Mainland and local artists to play in Hong Kong’s underground venues. Talk to be held in English 這場演講將介紹 Edward Sanderson 對中國大陸和香港聲音藝術及實驗音樂空間的研究，並描述他基於這項研究所進行的一些近期活動。 在過去的15年左右，他專注於聲音藝術和實驗音樂的空間，以及在這些空間中發展的與空間相關的實踐。他的研究地理範圍限於中國大陸和香港（已經是一個相當龐大的區域），研究時間從1990年代末到現在，同時他也會涉及一些早期的材料以提供背景。這項研究使他建立了一個實體檔案庫，目前位於香港，並由此產生了各種文本、活動和策展展覽。 這場演講將圍繞這項研究發展的四個重要階段進行：他在香港浸會大學視覺藝術學院的博士學位；2023年在大館當代藝術中心的“Sounds Like Print”展覽；最近結束的北京 Inside-Out 藝術博物館的展覽“它總是在某處響起”；以及“Exit-Entry”表演系列，邀請大陸藝術家與本地藝術家共同表演，進一步促進中國大陸與香港之間的聯繫和知識分享。 _______________ 簡介：Edward Sanderson 博士是一位研究者和策展人，專注於來自中國大陸和香港的當代非主流聲音實踐。在2025年，Edward 在北京 Inside-Out 藝術博物館策劃了展覽“它總是在某處響起”，展示了多種用於聲音藝術和實驗音樂的空間形式的安裝作品，並輔以一系列相關的表演和講座。Edward 正在開發一個與聲音相關的實體和在線檔案庫，並共同策劃 Exit-Entry 表演系列，將中國大陸藝術家和本地藝術家聚集在香港的地下場地演出。 講座將以英語進行。",

These bowls are played by striking or rubbing the rim with a mallet, creating harmonic sounds that promote relaxation and mindfulness. The sound waves produced can help to balance energy, reduce stress, and facilitate a meditative state. This ancient practice is rooted in various spiritual traditions and is gaining popularity in modern wellness for its ability to enhance emotional and physical well-being. - Calming Effect: The soothing tones of singing bowls can create a calming environment that helps reduce anxiety for both dogs and their owners, making it a perfect tool for relaxation. - Bonding Experience: Participating in sound healing sessions together can strengthen the bond between dogs and their owners, promoting feelings of safety and trust. - Stress Relief: Just as humans experience stress, pets can also feel anxious. The gentle sounds can help alleviate stress in dogs, making them more relaxed and at ease. - Enhanced Well-Being: Sound healing can promote physical and emotional well-being for both dogs and their masters, contributing to a healthier lifestyle and better quality of life. - Positive Environment: The vibrations and sounds can create a positive atmosphere that encourages playfulness and joy, benefiting the overall mood of the household. Overall, sound healing fosters a peaceful space that nurtures the connection between humans and their canine companions. 在以下鏈接預約位置： https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6Eac724J0yIOOs2qRryfTorMGgEFB95eMNlVCGWdpC-cMSg/viewform?usp=header票價：HKD$480，包含1人 + 1隻寵物（到達時支付） _______________________________ Shoji 將於 7 月 27 日為狗狗及其主人呈現一場頌缽音療約會。頌缽音療是一種治療性實踐，利用頌缽產生的共鳴音調和振動，這些頌缽通常由金屬或水晶製成。頌缽通過用槌子敲擊或摩擦邊緣來演奏，產生和諧的聲音，促進放鬆和正念。所產生的聲波可以幫助平衡能量、減少壓力並促進冥想狀態。這種古老的實踐根植於各種靈性傳統中，並因其增強情感和身體健康的能力而在現代健康領域中越來越受歡迎。 總括而言，音療促進了一個和平的空間，培養人類與其犬類伴侶之間的聯繫。",

This is what this gathering is about. For women changemakers. On August 10 Sunday afternoon, Carmen Chan of Girls Be Change and Dorothy Lam of Dream Impact are going to team up with published writer Gillian Del Mundo and certified sound meditation healer Carol Lee, to have this special community gathering to connect changemaking, creative writing, and sound healing together. Let's explore our inner creativity and voice to lead change from within. It is a gathering where everyone shows up as an equal participant, questioning and chatting. No panel. No presentation. No speech. Just intentional conversations. Come join us on Aug 10 (Sun) for an afternoon to meet other fellow women changemakers and explore your creativity via soundhealing and writing! What is Women Changemakers Community Series? The idea began in the summer of 2023 when two changemakers in Hong Kong, Carmen (Girls Be Change) and Dorothy (Dream Impact), questioned and envisioned what an ideal community is. We need a safe place among women changemakers to have organic meetups, intentional conversations and idea exchange with social ease, find inspirations and encouragement from each other, and build authentic friendships and support networks. The first Women Changemakers Community Gathering was held in Hong Kong on March 8, 2024 at International Women’s Day. Ever since then, Girls Be Change cohosted with 20 (and counting) organizations and gathered over 150 (and counting) women changemakers in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Kenya, and Tanzania. With 15+ gatherings around the globe, a vibrant community of global women changemakers was formed and connected virtually to raise questions, exchange ideas, and celebrate wins. ​Co-organizers:",

Venue: 21/F, Yoga and Fitness Room, Wellness, Eaton HK About Karen: I have been exploring fitness and well-being since 2015. I’m passionate about helping others fill their own cups and finding stillness in motion. My classes are challenging, but also joyful and calm. I teach uncomplicated sequences in a slow, alignment-based flow, always incorporating meditation and a savoured savasana. *Kindly ask a member of staff on the G/F to let you up to the 21/F upon arrival **Please arrive 10 min before class.

    "description": "Who we are Anahata Yoga is a premier yoga center based in the heart of the Central district. It is best known for offering the most authentic yoga experience available in Hong Kong, with classes led by Indian instructors hailing from different lineages devoted to the practice and study of yoga. As a center, Anahata Yoga is fully committed to fostering a community of yoga practitioners who are not only equipped with the skills to perform yoga as a daily activity, but as well as the knowledge to live out yoga as a lifestyle. Why us? We recognize that yoga is a popular pursuit in Hong Kong. People seek it out for its health benefits and often incorporate it into their active lifestyles. However, yoga instruction is not equal among the various yoga centers in Hong Kong. This is where our accredited Teacher Training Courses make all the difference. Our courses are accredited by, and offered in conjunction with, Asana Andiappan College of Yoga and Research Centre in India. This is the first time outside of India that such a program is being offered. Our classes are designed and taught in the same way as our instructors are taught. Predominantly from India, our instructors are fully learned not only in the practice of their discipline, but also in the history and philosophy behind the practice. The resulting combination of grassroots knowledge both practical and theoretical in our programs give students more in-depth learning than they may able to find elsewhere in Hong Kong.",
