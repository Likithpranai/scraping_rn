        "summary": "Back in the old days of China, seals were symbols of authority and power. These pocket-size stamps were used exclusively by the government to signify the importance of a document and the owner. Only the most talented craftsmen were trained to carve intricate Chinese characters into seals, a specialization that built seal carving schools throughout the country. But today, the once mysterious traditional art form can now be learned through an hour-long workshop at Aura Art in Hong Kong. Gain basic skills with the help of an expert tutor in just a short amount of time and be able to create your own right after the class. Learn the use of each and every tool laid out on your table - all of which you can use for as long as you want. Follow a simple pattern on a sample by watching your tutor's step-by-step demonstration. Once you get the hang of it, you can now chisel away and recreate a Chinese character you like. End the class with your finished product that will serve well as a great souvenir of your Hong Kong trip. Join the workshop now through Klook!",

        "description": "IRREGULart provides square towels, pencil cases, long bags, T-shirts, canvas bags, backpacks, neck scarves, pillow cases, etc. to choose from. In addition, students can also bring their own tie-dyed items and bring them to class to change them. New shapes can give a second life, or use some simple techniques to restore the popularity of meaningful old items, improve their memory, and add meaning to environmentally-themed creations. Students complete everything from material selection to design by themselves, and finally take the completed work home, adding a sense of ritual to life.",
        "summary": "Tie-dye has a long history. Originated from the Yellow River Basin. It is still uncertain when it originated. According to records, as early as the Eastern Jin Dynasty, knotted and anti-dyed twisted valerian silk had been produced in large quantities. Tie-dyeing generally uses cotton white cloth or cotton-linen blended white cloth as raw material. The tie-dying process is divided into two parts: tying and dyeing.",

Known as 'matryoshka' in its motherland, this folk toy is a set of wooden dolls fitted inside each other in a descending order. Each doll follows a theme - may it be political, a slice of life, or even pop culture. Try your hand at traditional Russian nesting doll-making with this workshop by Aura Art. Head over their studio in Central and be greeted by a friendly multilingual tutor. A short briefing will ensue and samples will be given as your guide throughout the class. Follow the tutor's step-by-step process for better results but feel free to have your way with your own set of dolls. Play around with colors and tools as you create a theme that personally interests you or speaks of your personality. Make sure to take home your finished set as souvenir - an interesting home decor with Russian origins, yet filled with memories of Hong Kong.
