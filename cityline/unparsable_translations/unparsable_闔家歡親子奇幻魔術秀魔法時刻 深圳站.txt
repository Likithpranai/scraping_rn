Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to translate specific fields in the given JSON object into English. The fields are source_address, enrich_neighborhood, and enrich_textEmbedding. First, I need to make sure I understand each of these fields correctly.

Starting with source_address: the original value is "深圳市羅湖區伯大尼博物館". Translating that into English, I need to convert the Chinese address. "深圳市" is Shenzhen City, "羅湖區" is Luohu District, and "伯大尼博物館" would be Bethany Museum. So putting it all together, the address should become "Bethany Museum, Luohu District, Shenzhen City".

Next is enrich_neighborhood, which is "羅湖區". As established earlier, that's Luohu District. So that's straightforward—translate it to "Luohu District" in English.

Then there's enrich_textEmbedding, which has a longer sentence. The original text is "闔家歡親子奇幻魔術秀《魔法時刻》在深圳羅湖區伯大尼博物館舉行，提供創意魔術與親子互動，適合全家共享奇幻與歡樂時光，演出融合大型視覺效果和遊戲元素，是一場融合文化與娛樂的精彩家庭活動。". I need to translate this into fluent English while maintaining the meaning. Let's break it down:

- 闔家歡親子奇幻魔術秀《魔法時刻》: The Family-Friendly Fantasy Magic Show 'Magic Moment'. I already have enrich_englishName as "Family-Friendly Fantasy Magic Show ‘Magic Moment’ - Shenzhen", so maybe use that title in the translation here as well.
- 在深圳羅湖區伯大尼博物館舉行: is held at the Bethany Museum in Luohu District, Shenzhen.
- 提供創意魔術與親子互動: offers creative magic and family interaction.
- 適合全家共享奇幻與歡樂時光: suitable for the whole family to enjoy a fantasy-filled and joyful time.
- 演出融合大型視覺效果和遊戲元素: The performance combines large-scale visual effects and game elements.
- 是一場融合文化與娛樂的精彩家庭活動: is an exciting family event that blends culture and entertainment.

Putting this all together in natural English: "Family-Friendly Fantasy Magic Show 'Magic Moment' is held at the Bethany Museum in Luohu District, Shenzhen, offering creative magic and family interaction, suitable for the whole family to enjoy a fantasy-filled and joyful time. The performance combines large-scale visual effects and game elements, making it an exciting family event that blends culture and entertainment."

I need to check if any of these fields were already in English, but according to the original JSON, source_name and enrich_englishName are in English. The other fields like source_address and enrich_neighborhood are in Chinese, so translation is needed. 

Also, ensure that no other parts of the JSON are altered. The keys must stay the same, and only the specified fields are translated. Let me verify the structure of the JSON again to confirm that. The example shows that enrich_textEmbedding is a string, so I need to maintain that as a translated string without changing any other values or structure.

Double-check the translations for accuracy. For the address, "深圳市羅湖區伯大尼博物館" becomes "Bethany Museum, Luohu District, Shenzhen City"—the order is correct in English, starting with the museum name, then district, then city. For enrich_neighborhood, "羅湖區" is Luohu District. The enrich_textEmbedding translation seems to capture all the elements, and I've used the English version of the event name from enrich_englishName to stay consistent.

Finally, make sure the JSON output is correct and free of any markdown. The user emphasized not including any explanations or formatting, just the raw JSON. Alright, that should cover all the required fields. Time to put it all together in the JSON format.
