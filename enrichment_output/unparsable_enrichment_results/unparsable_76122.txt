You are an expert data enrichment AI. Your task is to take a JSON object about a local activity and generate a new JSON object containing only enrichment fields.

**Instructions:**
1.  Analyze the provided "Input Activity Data".
2.  Generate a single JSON object that includes ONLY the new `enrich_` fields.
3.  Strictly follow the structure and format of the "Example Enrichment Object (Target Format)".
4.  Adhere to the descriptions for each `enrich_` field provided below.
5.  Do not include any explanations, apologies, or markdown formatting (like ```json) in your response. Output only the raw JSON object containing the enrichment fields.

**Field Descriptions for Enrichment:**

**Your generated JSON object (enrichment fields only):**


---RESPONSE---
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate a JSON object with only the enrichment fields based on the provided input data. First, I need to understand each field's requirements.

Starting with enrich_localName and enrich_englishName. The input title is "Myosotis Flower - Preserved Flowers on Night Lamp Workshop | Kwun Tong 2022". Since the neighborhood is Kwun Tong, I'll include that. The brand name here is "Myosotis Flower", so I should keep that in English. The activity is a workshop, so maybe something like "Preserved Flowers on Night Lamp Workshop | 美容與水療體驗 | 九龍城" for localName. Wait, no, the original example had "Wellness at The Murray" but this is a flower workshop. The Chinese part should probably be a description. The input mentions "Preserved Flowers on Night Lamp Workshop", so maybe translate that part. Let me check the example again. Oh, in the example, the Chinese part includes the name and location. So here, the localName should be "Myosotis Flower - Preserved Flowers on Night Lamp Workshop | 花藝工作坊 | 九龍城". Similarly, the English name would be "Myosotis Flower - Preserved Flowers on Night Lamp Workshop | Flower Art Workshop | Kwun Tong".

Next, enrich_type. The input is a workshop, so it's "local activities" as per the example. The example classified a spa as "local activities", so workshops should be the same.

enrich_neighborhood: The address is in Kwun Tong, Kowloon. So the neighborhood is "Kwun Tong".

enrich_hiddenGemScore: The input is a workshop, not a major hotel spa. The example gave 10 for a hotel spa, but this is a local workshop. Since it's a specific workshop with preserved flowers, maybe a higher score. Let's say 70. It's not a well-known brand, but it's a workshop, so maybe 70-80. The example had 10 for a hotel spa, which is low because they're major. This one is a local workshop, so higher. Let's go with 75.

enrich_textEmbedding: Need a paragraph combining title, summary, and highlights. The input includes flower arrangement, acrylic board, white pen, and other workshops like creamy art and floral frames. So something like "Join the Preserved Flowers on Night Lamp Workshop at Myosotis Flower in Kwun Tong, Hong Kong. This hands-on workshop allows participants to pick flowers from the studio, arrange them, and draw on an acrylic board. You'll receive a free white pen to personalize your acrylic board at home. Additional activities include the Creamy Art Workshop, where you can use pink glue and choose from over 300 mini figures to decorate items like mirrors and phone cases, and the Floral Frame Workshop using 50 compressed flowers. Other options are Dried Flowers and Preserved Flower Cards Workshops."

enrich_tagsType: The categories are Cultural experiences and Workshops. The example had Wellness at 80. Here, since it's a flower art workshop, "Art & Culture" would be high. Let's say 80 there. "Leisure" might be 20. The rest are 0. So {"Art & Culture": 80, "Leisure": 20}.

enrich_tagsBudget: The source_pricePoint is "$290". The example used "High-end" for a spa with a higher price. Since this is a workshop with a price around 294 HKD, which is moderate. Wait, the options are "Free", "Budget friendly", "Moderately priced", "High-end", "Luxury". The selling price is 294.3 HKD. In Hong Kong, that's probably moderately priced. So set "Moderately priced" to 1.

enrich_tagsGroup: The workshop is likely for friends or dates. Let's give "Friends" 60 and "Date" 40. That adds up to 100. No kids or family mentioned.

enrich_description: A concise under-20-word description. Maybe "A creative flower art workshop in Kwun Tong where you craft preserved flower night lamps and acrylic decorations."

Let me double-check all fields. Local name and English name have the brand in English and location. Hidden gem score is 75. TagsType sum to 100. TagsBudget has exactly one 1. TagsGroup sum to 100. Description is under 20 words. Looks good.
