Inside the stone spa room, the room temperature is kept at about 40-45°C with a humidity of around 65-70%. Those who are not comfortable with high-temperature saunas can enjoy this more moderate temperature option with peace of mind. Once you are lying on the stone bed, the heat spreads throughout your body and organs, bringing about an intense relaxation. As your body heats up, toxins will start to drain out with sweat.",

Allow children and adults to come into contact with a variety of small animals, including a close encounter with a little white rabbit. In addition, the manor also has interactive music performances and a variety of outdoor facilities for everyone to participate and use.
